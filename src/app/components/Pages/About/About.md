# About me

[[image of](me)]

Hey, my name is Max Panas. I'm 28 years old and I just
moved to London from sunny Athens, Greece. I work here as a
software engineer at Camelot Global, working to deliver one
of their mobile apps.

I have been professionally writing code for web and mobile 
for the past six years. Within the workplace I find great
enjoyment in sharing whatever I have learnt, mentoring and
getting people to work together. This blog is where I hope
to write down some of the moments and thoughts that I find
most interesting or useful during my life in software
development.

If you want to say hi, feel free to drop me a line or hit
me up on Twitter where I tweet as @mgjp_. I look forward to
hearing from you!

## Open Source

I can easily say that open source and the community 
surrounding it were some of the main reasons I ever got to
where I am today and one of the main things that make me 
really happy and proud to be in software development. The 
following are a few open source projects that I've had the
chance to kick off myself:

- The Mozaik WP Theme Starter - This is the project I am 
  most proud of. Built for what the rest of the development
  team and I dreamed our development environment should be
  able to support and do. This theme starter became the
  starting point for almost every project within the 
  company and since its release has seen adoption across
  the globe.

- Media Vault - This is the project I am most ashamed of.
  Not because of code quality or bad reception, but because
  I stopped supporting it. This WordPress plugin to allow
  users to block access to any file they wanted within
  their uploads folder was the first piece of open source I
  ever released. I am proud of what it does, but have found
  it incredibly difficult to find the time to go back and
  support it.

- eqheights - Using no runtime dependencies, ES6 and native
  DOM operations to make all elements in a selection the
  same height was fun when implementing this tiny helper.

- solve-conversion-path - This one is another fun one. I 
  wrote it to solve a problem I was having with a color
  manipulation library I was writing at the time. The 
  problem was: Given a set of converters, as a human, I 
  can easily pick out the conversions I would need to run
  in order to go from one color format to the next and I
  wanted my library to be able to do just that.

- and others...

## Speaking

Speaking has been something I've wanted to do for a long
time, but only recently built up the courage to do. I've
given my first couple of talks now and I am already 
planning to do more in the future. No looking back!
